# Python Programming Basics and Concepts

This repository contains Python code examples and explanations covering fundamental concepts of Python programming. It includes topics like basic syntax, data types, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming (OOPs), collections, exception handling, and file handling.

## Table of Contents

1. **Basic Concepts**
    - Understanding Python syntax and variables
    - Working with data types: int, float, string, list, tuple, dict, etc.
    - Control structures: if, else, loops (for, while)
    - Functions and modules: defining, calling, and importing
    
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**
    - Classes and objects: defining and using classes
    - Constructors and instance variables
    - Inheritance and polymorphism
    - Encapsulation and abstraction
    
3. **Collections**
    - Lists, tuples, and dictionaries: manipulation and iteration
    - Sets and frozensets: unique and unordered collections
    - Using collections module: defaultdict, Counter, namedtuple

4. **Exception Handling**
    - Handling exceptions with try, except, and finally
    - Custom exceptions and raising exceptions
    - Using context managers with `with` statement

5. **File Handling**
    - Opening, reading, and writing to files
    - Working with text files and binary files
    - Using `with` statement for safe file handling
